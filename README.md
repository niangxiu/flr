# Fast linear response algorithm

A highly efficient algorithm for computing the linear response of chaotic systems. This code accompanies the paper: "Fast differentiation of chaos", Angxiu Ni, https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00595

Do not worry about nan (not a number) warnings unless they appear in the results. I initialize all arrays with nan so that I do not accidentally use un-itended values.
